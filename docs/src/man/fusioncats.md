# Introduction 

The manual has been divided into different sections in an attempt to break down the information the user requires to use MultiTensorKit.jl.
We start off with a short summary of fusion category theory. Users familiar with TensorKit.jl may have read the [Optional introduction to category theory](https://jutho.github.io/TensorKit.jl/stable/man/categories/) in the documentation of TensorKit; this section can then largely be skipped. Be aware that notation may differ from the literature.

Afterwards, the extension to multifusion categories is explained, and its relation to (bi)module categories over fusion categories is shown. 

# Fusion category theory

The aim of this section is to explain the bare minimum required to proceed to the next section on multifusion category theory and bimodule categories. More details can be found in the [Optional introduction to category theory](https://jutho.github.io/TensorKit.jl/stable/man/categories/) or the book [Tensor Categories](add citation after figuring out how)
